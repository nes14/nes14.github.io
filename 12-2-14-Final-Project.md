##Intro to Ruby on Rails

###What I have done:
- I have updated/installed Rails/Ruby/Gems 
- I set up a server by running "$ rails s- " in my command line 
- I went to my localhost:3000 and I found my page
- I set up a blog with Rails and I was able to add posts and delete posts

### What I have left to do:
- Write up in a step by step process on how to check if Rails/Ruby/Gems are up to date.

Comments:
I have only tried doing everything on my personal Mac computer through the command line and I have not tried performing any of the tasks on a windows computer, yet.
