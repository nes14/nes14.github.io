##Web Components
- Custom Elements
- Templates
- Shadow DOM
- HTML Imports

There are 4 new web components coming to a browser near you. I've listed them above and I want to talk about what sticks out to me. 

`Templates`
The cool thing about templates is that you can make a template and with *HTML Imports* you can share it between your files or over the web. For example, let's say you're making a website for a beer distributor and you have to log all of showcase all of their inventory. Instead you can make a template that has about ten drinks. We can then import all of the info using with the help of some Javascript. 

`Shadow DOM`
My Object Oriented Programming Teacher raves about encapsulation. Shadow DOM is just that. You can hide styles and content from being accessed. It comes in handy if there are parts of your website that you want to keep hidden. 

`Custom Elements`
I see custom elements to be very useful for managing web apps and it reminds me of creating classes, instances of classes, and subclasses like you can in C#. It is very easy to take a button and give it the attributes of a button but also give it it's own characteristics.
