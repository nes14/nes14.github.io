##Web Components
- Custom Elements
- Templates
- Shadow DOM
- HTML Imports

There are 4 new web components coming to a browser near you. I've listed them above and I want to talk about what sticks out to me. 

`Templates`
The cool thing about templates is that you can make a template and with *HTML Imports* you can share it between your files or over the web. For example, let's say you're making a website for a beer distributor and you have to log all of showcase all of their inventory. Instead you can make a template that has about ten drinks. We can then import all of the info using with the help of some Javascript.
