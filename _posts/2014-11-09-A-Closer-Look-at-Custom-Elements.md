title: A Closer Look at Custom Elements

##Custom Elements
####First Impressions
While reading up on templates I started to have a vision. Templates and custom elements make it easier for developers to make widgets and web apps. For example, let's say that you're making a widget for a website. When a user comes to the website they are shown the current temperature of their current location. A user doesn't have to type any information in because the widget can gather that and display it right away. Widgets can be customizable by the user and they can become personalized with the information that the user needs. 

###Other Uses
It's hard to come up with uses for something I didn't even know was an issue. But the more I think about it the more I would want to implement custom elements and templates into my every day development. Lets say we are hired to do freelance web development. You can easily have a template ready displaying your services and your employeer can select and choose which services they would want from your 'job form'. 

##The Best Part
###Reusability.
We can resuse, share and import templates to use on the fly. We plug in our info and we're good to go. It speeds up development and makes our work easier for us.
