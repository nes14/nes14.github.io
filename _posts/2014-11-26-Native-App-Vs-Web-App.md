##Native Apps vs Web Apps

####My Experiences

I have worked on both native apps for iOS and responsive web apps and I can tell you which I prefer. But I can also tell you that you might be able to make more money doing the other one. Writing native apps means you must write in code that is indigenous to the platform. Meaning if you want to make an iOS app you must write in objective-c or swift. The problem with that is that people don't learn how to program with objective-c first. 

The great thing about building a web app is that your can script most of your code and make it responsive for **all** devices and you only have to write the same working backend code once. The javascript will work on most mobile browsers. HTML5 and modern browers make it even easier to work with due to web components and templating, which can cut down on the time it takes to develop a web application. 

A few problems I have with web apps are - "what happens when I don't have internet connection?" or "are these web apps going to suck up all of my bandwith?" Of course a great web app would be able to run on the browser through javascript and would make less calls back to a server. So if you were to load it once, you would have it on your phone for good (or until it time's out). With cell towers becoming more and more powerful and sending users more and more bandwith, it might not mater how much bandwith a web app sucks up but it would still save the users memory on their mobile phone for other things, such as music or photos. 

At this present time, I'm trying to do both. You never know which way the industry will turn. :sunglasses:
