##What Is Holding The Web Back

####Outdated browsers
First we have to find out what machines are running old outdated browsers. Yeah, your typical grandma from Kansas is running windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 or worse. But that is just one grandma. The majority of the culprits are big businesses.

###WHAT?!
*'Are you saying JPMorgan or Sears are running WindowsXP like my grandma?!'* I don't know for sure if they are running windows XP but think about it like this. These big companies have tons of computers. **Tons**. So in order to have an updated browser they must also update their operating systems. In order to update the operating systems or getting new operation systems all together companies must dish out big bucks for new computers or new operation systems. *If it ain't broke, don't fix it.*

Big companies make up part of the problem, grandma's make up a small chunk followed by people who don't know how or can't update their browsers. For example, let's say you are running the latest and greatest operating system but you need to run a virtual machine on your computer to play around or accomplish a different task. This is something that is *work related* and the fault lays on the companies yet again, not the common internet user. 

Lets assume JPMorgan counts their money using an old software. JPMorgan has a lot of money and they need it counted everyday, to make sure it's all there. If they were to update their system, their money counter would stop working. They would need to invest money in a new money counter. In updating, you are throwing a wrench into the system and it haults any progress until you create new applications that can run on new software.
