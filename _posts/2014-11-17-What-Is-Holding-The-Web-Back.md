##What is holding the web back

####Outdated browsers
First we have to find out what machines are running old outdated browsers. Yeah, your typical grandma from Kansas is running windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 or worse. But that is just one grandma. The majority of the culprits are big businesses. 
    
    ###WHAT?!
    **'Are you saying JPMorgan or Sears are running WindowsXP like my grandma?!'** I don't know for sure if they are running windows XP but think about it like this. These big companies have tons of computers. *Tons*. So in order to have an updated browser they must also update their operating systems. In order to update the operating systems or getting new operation systems all together companies must dish out big bucks for new computers or new operation systems. **If it ain't broke, don't fix it.**
