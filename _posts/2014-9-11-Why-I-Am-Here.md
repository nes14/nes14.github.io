#Why I Am Here

I am taking Web Emergent Technologies because I want to learn and expand my knowledge 
about web development. I believe that the future of technology is in web/app development and
that is always changing and as developers we must keep up with what's new because
it could end up making our jobs easier.

I am intestested in web development because it's fun and it comes easy to me. I enjoy making websites from 
scratch and I love learning new techniques. I also find web development very rewarding.
