##What is SMACCS

We're all guilty of having messy CSS. I know I do it to, I get excited about adding a button with a killer button shadow and I just drop that CSS where ever I end up making room for it. After reading up on [SMACCS](https://smacss.com/book/type-base) I've become a believer. SMACCS takes your CSS and puts stores it in 4 easy sections. If you get used to putting your CSS in their own sections you will easily find it when you need to make changes OR WHEN SOMEONE ELSE needs to make changes. 

The first type of storage is the Base attributes. 
{% highlight css %}
body, form {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
a {
    color: #039;
}
a:hover {
    color: #03F;    
}
{% endhighlight %}

Links and basic classes would be in the base. They would be out of the way and we wouldn't have to worry about them or need to touch them.

My personal favorite rule would have to be Module rules. This makes up most of the document and this would be where you might find yourself added most of your classes and attributes. This is where specific CSS would go.

Even though you're breaking your CSS into 4 distinct sections I believe that one could make up their own sections as long as they are all labeled for others to read. With great class names and seperate sections in the CSS one could easily edit it years after and find everything. :floppy_disk:
