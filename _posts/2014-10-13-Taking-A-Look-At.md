###Taking a look at:

##A Game of Shark and Minnow New York Times Interactive Website

After looking at this [page](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/) on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Mobile I was blown away most by how smoothly it ran on Internet Explorer. What I enjoyed most about this website was the audio sound track that played on only a few sections of the website. The audio gave me a sense of being on the ocean with the fisherman and that made me want to find out what other audio tracks were going to play on when I scrolled down that page, and that’s what I did. I was disappointed when the page went quiet. I assume that is because most people don’t want to listen to sounds and ambients while they read. I would have enjoyed if I was given the affordance to keep the sound on throughout the site. 

I found the transitions from one state of the page to another a little distracting. The fade in and fade outs overlapped each other and it was a little weird seeing that. I noticed that on the third scroll down the page took on a life of it’s own and began to zoom in on an island without me having to do anything. 

To me it feels like this site was a movie, a bunch of scenes lined up right after each other and they will only be shown in a particular order. I lost the sense of being able to control anything besides going up and down and that was a different experience.  :satisfied:
