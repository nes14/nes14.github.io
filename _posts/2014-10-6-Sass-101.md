##What is Sass?

Sass is a pre-processor that is supposed to make writing and organizing CSS a lot easier. (In a nut shell)
I have my likes and dislikes about it, and one of my favorite features about Sass are the variables. You're able to declare a variable at the very top of the page and then use it to represent a CSS value. It's handy when if repeating yourself throughout the CSS. If you need to go back and change the margins or the color of something it is much easier when you have these sassy variables!

####Sass Variables!
{% highlight css %}
$PrimaryLinksDuh: #5b9fe1;
$HelloStandMargins: 1.5rem 1rem;

header{
margins : $StandMargins;
}
{% endhighlight %}

###Nesting!
Sass lets you nest your classes inside other classes. This comes in handy because you can organize your CSS to match your HTML and everything will be easier to find. I like nesting because to me it is easier to read. I can tell I am making the color of the nav text $PrimaryLinks. 

{% highlight css %}
.header{
font-size:1.6rem;
  .nav{
      color: $PrimaryLinks;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
