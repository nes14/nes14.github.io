##What is Sass?

Sass is a pre-processor that is supposed to make writing and organizing CSS a lot easier. (In a nut shell)
I have my likes and dislikes about it, and one of my favorite features about Sass are the variables. You're able to declare a variable at the very top of the page and then use it to represent a CSS value. It's handy when if repeating yourself throughout the CSS.
####Sass Variables!
{% highlight css %}
$PrimaryLinks: #5b9fe1;
$StandMargins: 1.5rem 1rem;

header{
margins : $StandMargins;
}
{% endhighlight %}

###Nesting!
Sass lets you nest your classes inside other classes. This comes in handy because you can organize your CSS to match your HTML and everything will be easier to find. 

{% highlight css %}
.header{
font-size:1.6rem;
  .nav{
      color: $PrimaryLinks;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
